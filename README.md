# Wumpus_World_AI
Implemented Wumpus World using Python.

The Wumpus world is a cave with 16 rooms (4Ã—4). Each room is connected to others through walkways. We have a knowledge-based agent who will go forward in this world. The cave has a room with a beast which is called Wumpus, who eats anyone who enters the room. In the Wumpus world, there are some Pits rooms which are bottomless, and if agent falls in Pits, then he will be stuck there forever. One room there is a possibility of finding a gold. So the agent goal is to find the gold and get out of the cave without fallen into Pits or eaten by Wumpus.
